I am a student at the University of Texas at Austin studying Statistics and Data
Science. I am pursuing a career in Software Engineer. I am a big Green Bay Packers
fan. I love watching TV, playing Fantasy Football, reading Books, and listening
to music.

Here are some of books that I recently read:

<ul class="book-list-centered">
  <li>Golden Son</li>
  <li>Sword of Kaigen</li>
  <li>Intermezzo</li>
</ul>

<style>
  .book-list-centered {
    list-style: disc;
    list-style-position: inside; 
    padding-left: 0;             
    margin: 0 auto 1rem;
    text-align: center;          
  }
  .book-list-centered li { margin: .35rem 0; }
</style>
